# SLAMTEC Aurora--A New Era of Mapping and Localization solution
![](https://github.com/YahboomTechnology/SLAMTEC_Aurora/blob/main/SLAMTEC_Aurora.jpg)
# Introduction
Aurora is an integrated positioning and mapping sensor that integrates LiDAR, binocular vision, inertial navigation (IMU) and AI deep learning technology, with highly integrated 3D perception capabilities. Aurora can achieve high-precision indoor and outdoor 3D mapping as soon as it is turned on, without external dependencies, supports 6 DOF positioning, and is suitable for a variety of scenarios, such as multi-story building mapping and large-scale space mapping. We provide detailed tutorial materials, including graphical interactive software RoboStudio and SDK for secondary development, can help users expand different application projects.
# Features
* Fusion of LiDAR + binocular vision + IMU multi-source fusion algorithm.
* No need master control, it can complete indoor and outdoor 3D mapping and positioning functions.
* Mapping area can reach 100,0000m2, measurement distance up to 40M.
* Integrates AI technology to improve 3D perception capabilities, maintaining stable mapping and positioning even in high-speed motion environments.
* Comes with a handheld triangle bracket, which is convenient for users to completehandheld mapping or place it anywhere.
